# Script takes the processed data from the collider ppt expt (`DATA.RDATA`) or ppt.csv
# (which was cleaned and sliced in `preprocessing.R`) 
# and combines it with the pre-processed model predictions from `modpred_process2.R` (`tidied_preds4.csv`)
```

```{r}
setwd("../../Main_scripts_newexp")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
load('../Data/Data.Rdata', verbose = T) # This is one big df, 'data', 2640, of 220 ppts
data <- df2
mp <- read.csv('../model_data/tidied_preds4.csv') # 576 of 26 - 576 rows because: 3 pgroups x 12 trialtypes x 4 nodes x 4 prior possible settings of unobserved variables  

mp$pgroup <- as.factor(mp$pgroup)
mp$node3 <- as.factor(mp$node3)
mp$trialtype <- as.factor(mp$trialtype)
mp$structure <- as.factor(mp$structure)
mp$E.x <- as.factor(mp$E.x)
mp$E.y <- as.factor(mp$E.y)
```

Now the models.
Full model gets treated for actual causation here.

It also gets Kindness, later, in optimise scripts. Kindness is in the form of Total Variation Distacne between prior and posterior (see section below).

The model list for the three modules CES, actual and inference is the same with or without Kindess:

With Kindness:

full
noAct
noInf
NoSelect
noActnoInf
noActnoSelect
noActnoInfnoSelect
noInfnoSelect



### CESM model, with actual causation treatment, but no Kindness yet - will get that in next script

We want to allocate a cause as Actual when:
1) it equals the Effect
2) unobserved variable can only follow main variable

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Condition 1
mp <- mp %>% # 
  mutate(Actual = case_when(
    node2 == 'A' ~ A==E.x,
    node2 == 'B' ~ B==E.x,
    node2 == 'Au' ~ Au==E.x,
    node2 == 'Bu' ~ Bu==E.x
  ))

# Condition 2 - many of these are already caught but just to catch the extras 
mp$Actual[mp$A=='0' & mp$node3=='Au=1'] <- FALSE
mp$Actual[mp$B=='0' & mp$node3=='Bu=1'] <- FALSE
```

### The real full model including Kindness:


```{r, include=FALSE}
mp <- mp %>% 
  mutate(cesmActual = cesm*Actual)


# FULL inc kindness #1
full <- mp %>%  #1 
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(full = sum(cesmActual*posterior)) 

# Unnormalised of course and not incorporating K / EMD yet

```



```{r, include=FALSE}
# 

noAct <- mp %>%  #2
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(noAct = sum(cesm*posterior)) 

noInf <- mp %>%  #3
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(noInf = sum(cesmActual*PrUn)) 

noActnoInf <- mp %>%  #6
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(noActnoInf = sum(cesm*PrUn)) 


```


Now lesion the causal selection:

### Lesion causal selection

Need to get the individual posterior, for example, for Au, keep Au fixed and sum the joint posterior for each possible value of Bu.

(In my 'mp' there are 6 cells that make up the 1. You don't need to renormalise because you're pulling out of a set that sums to 1. )

Get the individual posteriors:

```{r, include=FALSE}
getpost <- mp %>% # 120 obs of 4
  filter(!node2 %in% c('A','B')) %>% # 
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node) %>% 
  summarise(post = sum(posterior),
            prior = sum(PrUn),
            tv = round(abs((post-prior)),3)) # Maybe don't divide here by 2? Because both Au=1 and Au=0 need the value separately

```


```{r, include=F}

postmp <- merge(mp, getpost, by = c('pgroup', 'trialtype', 'node'), all.x = TRUE)

# For A and B, gives 1 when E matches, 0 if not. This sets B to 1 for actual cause, eg. if B=0 when E=0
postmp <- postmp %>% # 
  mutate(Act1 = case_when(
    node2 == 'A' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'B' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'Au' ~ post,
    node2 == 'Bu' ~ post
  ))

postmp <- postmp %>% #
  mutate(noSelect = case_when(
    node2 == 'A' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'B' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'Au' ~ post*Actual,
    node2 == 'Bu' ~ post*Actual
  ))

```


Get the causal score. This now fine as long as the posterior doesn't need to be calculated AFTER.

```{r, include=FALSE}

noSelect <- postmp %>% #14
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(noSelect = mean(noSelect)) 


noActnoSelect <- postmp %>% #14
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarise(noActnoSelect = mean(Act1)) 

```


Now treat for both inference and causal selection at same time: people select among actual causes almost indiscriminately.

### Lesioning both inference and selection


```{r, include=FALSE} 

mp <- mp %>% # 
  mutate(Act3 = case_when(
    node2 == 'A' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'B' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'Au' ~ peA*Actual,
    node2 == 'Bu' ~ peB*Actual
  ))

noInfnoSelect <- mp %>% #10
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop = F) %>% 
  summarise(noInfnoSelect = mean(Act3))




```


Assign causal score of C=1 to observed variables if Actual cause, and prior to unobserved variables.

```{r, include=FALSE} 

mp <- mp %>% # 
  mutate(Act2 = case_when(
    node2 == 'A' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'B' ~ Actual,
    node2 == 'Au' ~ peA,
    node2 == 'Bu' ~ peB
  ))


noActnoInfnoSelect <- mp %>% # no act here means for the unobserved variables 
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop = F) %>% 
  summarise(noActnoInfnoSelect = mean(Act2))


```


Now all the models are in same format, we can merge them back together. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
df_list <- list(full, 
                noAct, 
                noInf, 
                noSelect, 
                noActnoInf, 
                noActnoSelect, 
                noInfnoSelect, 
                noActnoInfnoSelect) 

models <- df_list %>% reduce(full_join, by = c('pgroup', 'trialtype', 'node3'))

```

Also get Actual (and anything else we need to pull in about the conditions? Add it here)

```{r,}
Actual <- mp %>% select(pgroup, trialtype, node3, Actual) %>% unique()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
models2 <- merge(models, Actual, all.x = TRUE)
```


Now bring in participant data:

```{r, include=FALSE}
# ------------- 2. Summarise participant data in same format ---------------------

# First set factors so we can use tally
data$pgroup <- as.factor(data$pgroup)
data$node3 <- as.factor(data$node3)
data$trialtype <- as.factor(data$trialtype)
#data$isPerm <- as.factor(data$isPerm)

# Some confusion over whether we want realLat or isPerm - and how to feed those things to the chart later
# We want both. realLat applies to both model and data, so is tagged here to model.
# isPerm is a data value so is tagged here to data. The combnorm takes them both to variable settings

# Bring in the isPerm status of all the node answers actually given
# dataPlaceholder <- data %>% # 214
#   na.omit() %>%
#   group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, isPerm) %>% # prob no need for .drop because the isPerm val is the same for both values of the var
#   tally

dataNorm <- data %>% # 289
  group_by(pgroup, trialtype, node3, .drop=FALSE) %>% # Here we do need the .drop to get all the combinations
  tally %>% 
  mutate(prop=n/sum(n))
```

### Computational kindness

Kindness here is Total Variation between the prior and posterior, for Au=0, Au=1, Bu=0, Bu=1, so at variable level. 

```{r, include=FALSE}

tv2 <- getpost %>% 
  select(pgroup, trialtype, node, tv) %>% 
  rename(node3 = node)

# Merge with data just because it's needed across all models so best do it once here
dataNorm <- merge(x=dataNorm, y=tv2, all.x = T) 

```


```{r, include=FALSE}
# ----------- 3. The actual merge! ------------ 

modelAndData <- merge(x=dataNorm, y=models2) 

modelAndData <- modelAndData %>% 
  unite('pg_tt', pgroup, trialtype, sep = "_", remove = FALSE)

#modelAndData <- modelAndData[, c(1:4, 7:12, 5, 13:16)]
```


```{r}
write.csv(modelAndData, '../model_data/modelAndDataUnfit.csv')  
```
