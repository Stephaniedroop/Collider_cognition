# Big finding: the new version is half the scores of the old finding for C=E (ie actual causes).
# This probably because the simulation of cfs only uses half, because some /0
# Question is whether this is important once it gets softmaxed
# For the ones C!=E, the Neil function has a flip to make it negative. Is this better? Otherwise they are mostly the same
# Try model fit with QL version
