# Scripts and data for a behavioural experiment and computational models to study how human cognition uses both causal selection and causal inference to generate explanations for observed phenomena

## Languages

All scripts are in R, v.4.1. Packages needed are below with citations. 

## How to run

- or **analysis** go to the `Scripts` folder and run `master.R`, or if you know what script you are looking for you can go straight there and run that only. See list of scripts below.
- This structure assumed you have a renv and .rproj doc with here set to the .rproj.
- To see and try the behavioural experiment go to https://eco.ppls.ed.ac.uk/~s0342840/collidern/collidertop.html. Code for the task interface and structure of running it in JavaScript in in the folder `Other/hostExperiment`. To click through the experiment: at the comprehension check enter Yes, No, True, 12.

## Files, folders, model

### FOLDER Scripts

- `master.R` - top level analysis script. **Go here first**

It will first source a few scripts holding static utilities: 
- `cesmUtils.R` - functions to run the CESM model
- `optimUtils.R` - functions to fit and optimise models
- `plotUtils.R` - functions to generate plots

The masterscript sources scripts in the following order:

a) Processing behavioural experiment data (see folder `Other/hostExperiment` for the JS code of experiment):

- `01preprocess.R` - Get the participants' behavioural experiment data ready. Saves as `Data.Rdata` in folder `Data`

2. Set up Collider worlds (see note on worlds below) and get CESM (Quillien+Lucas23) model predictions for those for the _causal selection_ part of the model:

_Btw in the middle of a reconstruction of files and names at 21 Sept 2025_

- `02setParams.R` - short script to set the manipulated probabilities of the variables
- `03getPreds.R` - get CESM model predictions. Output `all.rda`
- `04processPreds.R` - put model predictions in a user-friendly format, renames variables, splits out node values 0 and 1. Input: `all.rda`, output `modelproc.rda`

3. Other modelling

- `05getLesions.R` calculates the _inference_, _computational kindness_ and _actual causality_ parts of the full models, then progressively lesions. Input `modelproc.rda` and `Data.rdata`, output `modelAndDataUnfit.rda`
- `06optimise.Rmd` fits and optimises models. Input `modelAndDataUnfit.rda`, output `fit16mpn.csv`.
- `07processForPlot.Rmd` - an intermediate file for the clumsy relabelling, to stop the actual plotting file getting unwieldy. Input: `fit16mpn.csv`; output `fitforplot16mpn.csv`
- `08samplePreds.Rmd` - get an actual sample from model for each participant trial. Input: `Data.Rdata` and `fitforplot16mpn.csv`, output: a glmer result in the console and reported in the Unobserved variables section of the paper and `forplotbyppt.csv`. (TO DO: should this not be used for the freestanding analyses scripts too)
- `09testSamp.R` - Test the matched sampled explanations against participants for our theory metrics
- `10reportFigs.R` generates plots on a pattern with functions from `plotUtils.R`. Most are 'nice to have' and not reported. Input `fitforplot16mpn`, output figures saved in folder `Other`, `Plots`. _TO DO_: 1) add code to save plots as .png too for wider comms.
- `11reportFigs2.R` individual plots using customised calls, for reporting.
- `12fitByppt.R` how many ppts are best fit by each model. Input `Data.Rdata` and `fitforplot16mpn`. Output: table of results in the console

4. Free-standing analyses for reporting

- `coverTest.Rmd` - Freestanding analysis to check if cover story affects answers (it doesn't - except lightly in 2/36 conditions, due to noise)
- `demogs.R` - demographics on participant behavioural data
- `abnormalInflation.Rmd` - check for presence of abnormal inflation and deflation (documented behavioural phenomena of causal selection) are found in our data, which would be support for causal selection theory. [Preliminary analysis finds no evidence, unlike in the cogsci paper]. Input `Data.Rdata`, output: table of results in the console.
- `chisq.r` - check whether participants answer non-uniformly in each world. Input `modelAndDataUnfitpn.csv`, output: table of results in the console.



### FOLDER Experiment

Holds the Javascript and html to run the behavioural experiment, which is an online interface with a task like a game. Participants from Prolific were paid to complete the task in early July 2024.

### FOLDER Data, pilot_data

Participant data from the behavioural experiment.

## Glossary

Some everyday words have a special sense in this project.

- `world` - a setting of observed node variables A and B, and outcome E set by deterministic structural equations. A single iteration of how things started off and turned out. Each node can take 0 or 1. Sometimes represented by the values of A,B,E in order, eg. 110 means A=1, B=1, E=0, ie. that A and B both happened and the effect didn't.
